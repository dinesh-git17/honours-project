## Overview

This repository contains my Honours Thesis, which explores the mathematical foundations and algorithms of machine learning techniques such as:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forests**
- **Neural Networks**

Additionally, it examines various evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, and discusses the ethical and social implications of machine learning.

## Structure

- `thesis.pdf` - The full thesis document in PDF format.
- `code/` - Folder containing Python and R scripts used for model implementations and evaluations.
- `README.md` - This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Key Features

- **Mathematical Foundation**: Detailed mathematical explanations behind popular ML algorithms.
- **Practical Implementations**: Python and R scripts demonstrating model implementation.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Performance comparison using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
- **Ethical Discussion**: A section discussing the ethical and social impact of machine learning.
